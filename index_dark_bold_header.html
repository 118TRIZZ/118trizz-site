        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>118trizz is more than a brand — it's a story. “118” comes from my mom’s house in Syracuse, NY. That home inspired the love and warmth we try to bring into every product. “Trizz” is my own personal touch — a tag that’s been with me through the journey.</p>

            At 118trizz, safety is our number one priority. Every bar of soap is made using high-quality, skin-friendly ingredients.
            We meticulously test each formula to ensure it's gentle enough for all skin types. Our soaps are free from parabens, sulfates,
            and harsh synthetic chemicals that can irritate or dry the skin. We use natural oils and butters that are known to nourish,
            hydrate, and restore your skin's balance. Every batch is handcrafted in a clean, controlled environment. We never test on animals,
            and we stand firmly against cruelty in any form. Our scents come from pure essential oils and skin-safe fragrance blends.
            We maintain transparent labeling so you know exactly what you're using. Our products are pH balanced to match the skin’s natural level.
            From production to packaging, we take steps to minimize contamination and maximize purity. We continuously seek feedback to improve
            and adapt our methods. Even our colorants are derived from mineral or botanical sources. Whether you have sensitive skin or just want
            a safe, everyday option, 118trizz has you covered. We believe soap should cleanse without compromise. When you choose 118trizz,
            you’re choosing care, trust, and safety with every wash.
